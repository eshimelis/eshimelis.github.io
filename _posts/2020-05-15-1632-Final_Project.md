This was my final project for 16.32: Principles of Optimal Control and Estimation, a graduate class I took at MIT in the spring of 2020. The goal of the project was to use a understand how to optimize multi-agent trajectories to provide 

The problem was posed as an optimization problem, with the goal of maximizing the information derived from sensors, while minimizing the 

This project describes the implementation and results of using GPOPS-II to determine locally-optimal solutions for multi-agent path planning. The problem is formulated as a numerical optimization over space and time, with the goal of maximizing the position information of a primary agent. The solution is computed jointly; that is, an augmented state vector containing the states of all agents. The goal is to escort an autonomoous agent across an obstacle-filled map, while minimizing the time and expended control effort. With an adequate initial guess, GPOPS-II is able to find an optimal solution for all agents in a reasonable time (approx. 10 min) for four agents and five obstacles. This method, however, is not ideal for larger problems due to scaling issues, which are discussed later in the report.
