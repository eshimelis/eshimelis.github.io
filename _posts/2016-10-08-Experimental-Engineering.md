This might very well be the most useful course I took as an undergrad...

The course is focused on model rocketry. It covers multiple engineering disciplines from instrumentation/measurement techniques to thrust & flight modeling. All in all, I learned how to be effectively plan, conduct, and present lab experiments.

For our final project, my team and I built and flew an Aerotech Arreaux, outfitted with custom-designed sensors to measure the effects of mass distribution on surface and body vibrations. The final report is embeded below the video.

We placed a camera on one of the four flights, check it out below. Warning, it gets a little loud.
